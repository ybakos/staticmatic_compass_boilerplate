Need to generate a static site but suddenly find your stomach turns without the help of your friends Haml and Sass?

Want to use a proper grid layout but don't smoke enough cigarettes to call yourself a graphic designer?

Use this handy boilerplate project. It relies on StaticMatic to generate the final static html from your haml views and sass styles. I've added a basic compass configuration that allows you to immediately start using blueprint.

ASSUMPTIONS
This uses Capistrano to deploy the site, and your production server should treat yourwebdir/current as its public Web root.
