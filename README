Need to generate a static site but suddenly find your stomach turns without the help of your friends Haml and Sass?

Want to use a proper grid layout but don't smoke enough cigarettes to call yourself a graphic designer?

Use this handy boilerplate project. It relies on StaticMatic to generate the final static html from your haml views and sass styles. I've added a basic compass configuration that allows you to immediately start using blueprint.

HOW TO USE THIS SHIT
--------------------

First, clone a temporary copy of this to your local machine and cd into the repo root. eg:

git clone git://github.com/ybakos/staticmatic_compass_boilerplate.git my_temp_dir
cd my_temp_dir

Since this is a boilerplate, I recommend you export this into your real project directory, eg:

git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=/projects/my_new_web_site/

** don't forget that trailing slash, beatch! **

Next, cd into your new project directory, and create your own git repo, eg:

cd /projects/my_new_web_site
git init

And I think you can take it from there.


ASSUMPTIONS
This uses Capistrano to deploy the site, and your production server should treat yourwebdir/current as its public Web root.
